**********Front Page**********
When you go to the quiz, the front page loads. Timer hasn't started yet, but you can view saved high scores (if there are any) and you can select the 'start quiz' button.

**********Questions**********
Once you start the quiz, you can select your answer, and immediately find out if you're right or wrong. There are 6 questions but more can easily be added.

**********Last Page**********
When either the time has run out (you have 60 seconds, with 5 seconds demoted for every wrong answer) or you have finished the set of questions, your score is ready to be saved along with your initials.

**********High Score Page (and Modal)**********
After you enter your initials, you can see the high score board (and clear it, if you'd like). You can also view the high scores at any time during the quiz by selecting the "View High Scores" in the top left corner. Now that you've finished the test, you can start all over again and try and beat your score! Good luck.
